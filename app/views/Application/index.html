<strong>The therapeutic value of a chemical compound
depends on what it does on the body rather than how it looks like.</strong>
The Functional Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (FTC) abstracts 
away from the traditional chemical structure-based approach and focuses solely on the mode
of action of drugs. The classification sorts therapeutic
agents based on their function in the human body.</p>

<p class="feature-presentation">
<strong>A substance often does more than just one thing in the human body.</strong>
Most of the times it results in side-effects to be prevented, but sometimes they can lead
to valuable repositionning opportunities. The Functional Therapeutic Chemical Classification 
System (FTC) helps to discover and understand the implicit functions born by 
approved therapeutic compounds in the human system.

<p class="feature-presentation"><strong>From the web application code to drug
repositionning hypotheses, everything is open and free.</strong> The 
Functional Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (FTC) integrates and leverages the public content of
the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology</a>, 
<a href="http://www.drugbank.ca/">DrugBank</a>, <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">Uniprot</a> and
